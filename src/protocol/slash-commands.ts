/**
 * Discovers the slash commands a session can offer and expands them when the
 * user invokes one.
 *
 * ACP clients fill their `/` autocomplete from the `available_commands_update`
 * notification an agent sends after `session/new` (and load / fork / resume).
 * Commands are then invoked as ordinary prompt text — the client sends
 * `"/commit group by feature"` as a text block and the agent is responsible for
 * recognising the prefix.
 *
 * We read the same on-disk layout Claude Code uses, so a project that already
 * ships commands or skills works without extra configuration:
 *
 *   <cwd>/.claude/commands/<name>.md     → `/name` (nested files become `/dir:name`)
 *   <cwd>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md → `/name`
 *
 * plus the same two directories under `~/.claude` for user-level commands.
 * Project definitions win over user-level ones with the same name.
 *
 * All I/O errors are swallowed: having no commands at all is the common case,
 * and a broken command file should never fail `session/new`.
