# glm-acp-agent

An [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com) agent written in TypeScript that uses the **Z.AI / Zhipu AI GLM** model family (GLM-5.3, GLM-5.3 Flash, GLM-5 Turbo, GLM-4.7) as its reasoning core.

The agent connects to any ACP-compatible IDE or client over **stdio**, streams responses back in real time, and can call a rich set of tools to interact with the user's file system, terminal, and the web.

Streaming responses must include a supported terminal finish reason. An early connection close is reported as an interrupted response, with received text retained for session replay. Tool calls run only after a complete `tool_calls` response; calls in output-limit (`length`) or filtered (`content_filter`) responses are discarded and the corresponding stop reason is preserved.

Completed provider reasoning is retained unchanged in conversation history and saved sessions for subsequent model calls, even when thought display is disabled. `ACP_GLM_STREAM_THINKING=false` controls client display only. Reasoning from cancelled, incomplete, or output-limited responses is not replayed as a completed reasoning chain.

---

## Coding Plan Only

`glm-acp-agent` is intentionally built for the **Z.AI GLM Coding Plan**. It is not a general-purpose Z.AI Open Platform API client.

By default, model calls use the Coding Plan endpoint:

```text
https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4
```

The same Coding Plan API key is used for the agent's GLM model calls and supported Coding Plan tools. General Z.AI API/resource-package billing surfaces, such as direct `/api/paas/v4` Tool API calls, are intentionally out of scope for this ACP agent.

Built-in web tools use Coding Plan-compatible MCP endpoints, not the general `/api/paas/v4` Tool API. If you need general Z.AI API billing, separate resource packages, or non-Coding Plan endpoints, use a different provider configuration or fork this agent for that purpose.

## Features

- **Full ACP compliance** – implements `initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new`, `session/set_mode`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`, `session/close`, `session/list`, `session/load`, `session/fork`, `session/resume`, and `session/set_model`, and pushes `session_info_update`, `config_option_update`, `current_mode_update`, and `available_commands_update` notifications
- **Streaming** – assistant text and reasoning tokens are forwarded as incremental ACP chunks
- **Tool calling** – agentic loop with a configurable cap of GLM function-calling turns (default 100; see `ACP_GLM_MAX_TURNS` / `--max-turns`)
- **Thinking mode** – GLM's `reasoning_content` tokens are surfaced as `agent_thought_chunk` blocks so the client can show the model's chain of thought
- **Session permission modes** – supports `default`, `accept_edits`, and `bypass_permissions` via `session/set_mode`. Clients like DevFlow can use this to toggle between prompting for every edit, auto-approving edits while prompting for commands, or bypassing permissions entirely.
- **Per-session model switching** – `session/set_model` lets clients change the active GLM model mid-conversation; `session/new` returns the curated `availableModels` list
- **Slash commands** – commands and skills found under the session's `.claude/` directory are advertised to the client with `available_commands_update`, so `/` autocomplete is populated (see [Slash commands](#slash-commands))
- **Image input via Coding Plan-native vision or Vision MCP** – `promptCapabilities.image` is advertised; `glm-5.3-flash` sends supported pasted ACP image blocks directly as native `image_url` content parts, while the other advertised coding models (including default `glm-5.3`) route them through Z.AI Vision MCP (`@z_ai/mcp-server`). `glm-5v-turbo` keeps the same native-vision path when re-added via `ACP_GLM_AVAILABLE_MODELS` — it is no longer on the Coding Plan allowlist. Direct chat-image-only models (e.g. `glm-4v-plus`) are intentionally not used.
- **Session persistence** – conversations are written to `~/.local/state/glm-acp-agent/sessions/` and can be reloaded via `session/load`, branched via `session/fork`, or resumed without replay via `session/resume`
- **Nine built-in tools** (see below)
- **Self-sufficient local tools** – directory listings and shell commands always run in the agent process; file tools fall back to local filesystem access when ACP client `fs` capabilities are unavailable
- **Configurable permissions** – `write_file` and `run_command` behavior depends on the active session mode (prompts by default)
- **Protocol-correct stop reasons** – maps model and runtime conditions to ACP `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, `max_turn_requests`, `refusal`, and `cancelled`
- **Protocol-correct tool statuses** – `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed` / `failed`
- **Token usage reporting** – aggregated usage is returned on the `session/prompt` response

## Architecture

```text
ACP Client (IDE plugin, CLI, …)
        │  stdio (ndjson)
        ▼
  GlmAcpAgent          ← ACP protocol layer  (src/protocol/)
        │
        ├─ GlmClient   ← Z.AI / Zhipu AI Coding Plan Chat Completions  (src/llm/)
        │
        ├─ ToolExecutor ← executes tool calls  (src/tools/)
        │    ├─ read_file / list_files        → ACP client fs for read_file when read/write are advertised, else Agent process (Node fs); read_file paginated (offset/limit)
        │    ├─ write_file / edit_file        → ACP client fs when advertised (editor-buffer diffs), else Agent process (Node fs)
        │    ├─ list_files / run_command     → Agent process (Node fs / child_process)
        │    ├─ web_search / web_reader      → Z.AI Coding Plan Web MCP (HTTP)
        │    ├─ image_analysis               → Z.AI Coding Plan Vision MCP (stdio)
        │    └─ todowrite                    → Agent process (per-session task list; replaces chat narration)
        │
        └─ VisionMcpClient ← spawns `npx @z_ai/mcp-server` on demand
```

The agent process needs network access to `api.z.ai` for chat completions and Web MCP, plus `npx` available on `PATH` so it can launch `@z_ai/mcp-server` for vision. Filesystem and shell operations use paths resolved against the ACP session working directory. When the client advertises `fs.writeTextFile`, writes and edits are routed through the ACP client so they render as native diffs. When it advertises both `fs.readTextFile` and `fs.writeTextFile`, `read_file` and edit-file reads also use the editor buffer; otherwise those reads fall back to the agent process filesystem. Writes and arbitrary shell commands still go through ACP `session/request_permission`, and the permission payload is always the **full** tool arguments — the user approves exactly what will run.

Client-facing tool cards stay compact: long strings in `rawInput`/`rawOutput` (and in the `read_file` content preview) are elided to a short head plus a character count. Model-facing tool results are also capped at a UTF-8 byte boundary; write payloads and permission requests remain complete. Progress narration lives in the `todowrite` task list rather than prose, and reasoning tokens are only forwarded as `agent_thought_chunk` when `ACP_GLM_STREAM_THINKING` is not `false` (the default preserves streaming).

## Available Tools

| Tool | Runs on | Permission behavior | Description |
|------|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| `read_file` | ACP client when both fs read/write capabilities are advertised, otherwise agent process | Always silent | Read a text file or editor buffer, paginated by offset/limit (default 2000 lines, capped at 5000). Local scans are byte-bounded; totals can be unknown and an incomplete line is never given a next offset. |
| `write_file` | Agent process (ACP client `fs` when advertised) | Mode-dependent | Write or overwrite a text file. Silent in `accept_edits` and `bypass_permissions`. |
| `edit_file` | Agent process (ACP client `fs` when advertised) | Mode-dependent | Replace one exact, unique snippet in an existing file. It refuses an input or editor buffer over the read/edit budget, and re-validates after permission so concurrent edits are not overwritten. Silent in `accept_edits` and `bypass_permissions`. |
| `todowrite` | Agent process | Always silent | Create or replace the session's structured task list so multi-step progress is tracked instead of narrated in chat. Each call replaces the list; the tool result renders it back to the model. |
| `list_files` | Agent process | Always silent | List a directory through a bounded iterator; a truncated result is a disclosed subset. |
| `run_command` | Agent process | Mode-dependent | Run an arbitrary shell command; cancelling a turn terminates its shell process group, while intentionally backgrounded processes survive a normal shell exit. Silent only in `bypass_permissions`. |
| `web_search` | Agent (Z.AI Coding Plan MCP) | Always silent | Search the web — returns titles, URLs, and summaries |
| `web_reader` | Agent (Z.AI Coding Plan MCP) | Always silent | Fetch and parse a web page (markdown or plain text) |
| `image_analysis` | Agent (Z.AI Vision MCP, stdio) | Always silent | Analyze a local image path or remote URL using `@z_ai/mcp-server` |

### Session Modes

Clients can use `session/set_mode` to drive the permission policy:

| Mode ID | Name | `write_file` | `run_command` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | Ask for permission | **Prompt** | **Prompt** |
| `accept_edits` | Auto-approve edits | Silent | **Prompt** |
| `bypass_permissions` | Bypass all permissions | Silent | Silent |

Reads, listings, and MCP tool calls are always silent across all modes.

---

## Slash commands

After `session/new`, `session/load`, `session/fork`, and `session/resume`, the agent
sends an ACP [`available_commands_update`](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v2/slash-commands)
notification. Clients such as Zed and Paseo use it to populate their `/` autocomplete.
Each notification is a full snapshot that replaces the previous list.

The snapshot is built from the same on-disk layout Claude Code uses, read from the
session's working directory and from `~/.claude` for user-level definitions:

| Path | Command name |
|---|---|
| `<cwd>/.claude/commands/commit.md` | `/commit` |
| `<cwd>/.claude/commands/review/pr.md` | `/review:pr` |
| `<cwd>/.claude/skills/audit/SKILL.md` | `/audit` |

Project definitions shadow user-level ones with the same name. The `description`
and `argument-hint` keys of a file's YAML frontmatter become the menu entry's
description and input hint; without a `description`, the first heading (then the
first line) of the body is used instead.

Advertised names are sent **without** a leading slash — the client prepends it for
display and invokes the command by sending `/name …` as ordinary prompt text. When
that text names an advertised command, the agent injects the definition's body into
the user message, substituting `$ARGUMENTS` where the file asks for it and otherwise
appending the typed arguments. Unknown `/foo` is left untouched and reaches the model
as prose, so typing a slash by accident never fails the turn.

### Built-in commands

Two commands ship in the agent itself and need no definition file:

- `/usage` — shows GLM Coding Plan quota (5-hour window, weekly, MCP). Answers
  locally; no model call.
- `/compact [focus]` — asks the model once, with no tools, to summarize the
  whole conversation (request, key decisions, files changed, current state,
  next steps), then replaces the history with `[system, user(summary)]` and
  persists immediately, so a context gauge falls on the same turn. Free text
  after the command is passed to the model as the summary's focus. If the
  summary call fails or times out (120 s), the original history is kept and
  the error is reported in-band.

A `.claude/commands/compact.md` (or `usage.md`) in the project or `~/.claude`
shadows the built-in of the same name: the file definition wins and the prompt
reaches the model as an ordinary slash-command expansion.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20.19.0+, 22.13.0+, or 24+ (native `fetch` and Web Streams required)
- **npm** 9 or later
- A **Z.AI API key** — obtain one at <https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list>

---

## Installation

### Quick Start

Install the published package globally to get the `glm-acp-agent` command on your `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g glm-acp-agent@latest
```

Then either export your Z.AI API key and run it directly:

```bash
export Z_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
glm-acp-agent
```

…or run the interactive setup once to persist the key to disk (see [One-time setup](#one-time-setup)) and point any ACP-compatible client at the `glm-acp-agent` command.

### From Source (Development)

Clone the repository if you want to hack on the agent or pin a specific commit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefandevo/glm-acp-agent.git
cd glm-acp-agent
npm install
npm run build
```

The build output lands in `dist/`; the rest of this README uses `node dist/index.js` whenever it refers to the source-build entry point.

---

## Configuration

The agent reads its configuration from environment variables, plus an optional credentials file written by `glm-acp-agent --setup`.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `Z_AI_API_KEY` | One of env / `--setup` | — | API key for the Z.AI / Zhipu AI service. If unset, the credentials file is consulted. |
| `ACP_GLM_MODEL` | No | `glm-5.3` | Default GLM model for new sessions |
| `ACP_GLM_AVAILABLE_MODELS` | No | built-in list | Comma-separated list of model ids advertised in `session/set_model` |
| `ACP_GLM_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` | Override the API base URL |
| `ACP_GLM_MAX_TOKENS` | No | `32768` | Cap on `max_tokens` for each completion |
| `ACP_GLM_MAX_TURNS` | No | `100` | Max model/tool turns per prompt (also settable via `--max-turns`) |
| `ACP_GLM_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `120000` | Deadline for each `run_command`, in milliseconds. Invalid values fall back to the default with a stderr warning. |
| `ACP_GLM_COMMAND_OUTPUT_LIMIT_BYTES` | No | `65536` | Maximum combined bytes captured from each `run_command` stdout and stderr. Further output is drained and reported as truncated. Invalid values fall back to the default with a stderr warning. |
| `ACP_GLM_TOOL_RESULT_LIMIT_BYTES` | No | `262144` | Inclusive UTF-8 byte limit for every model-facing tool result. It preserves a prefix and suffix with an omitted-bytes marker; values below 128 fall back with a stderr warning. |
| `ACP_GLM_READ_FILE_LIMIT_BYTES` | No | `8388608` | Maximum local bytes consumed while reading a page or whole file for `edit_file`. A bounded scan may not know the total line count. |
| `ACP_GLM_LIST_FILES_MAX_ENTRIES` | No | `2000` | Maximum entries collected by `list_files`; larger directories return a disclosed subset. |
| `ACP_GLM_LIST_FILES_LIMIT_BYTES` | No | `262144` | Maximum bytes assembled for a `list_files` result before its truncation marker. |
| `ACP_GLM_THINKING` | No | auto-detected | Force thinking mode `true` / `false` |
| `ACP_GLM_STREAM_THINKING` | No | `true` | Forward reasoning tokens to the client as `agent_thought_chunk`; set `false` to keep reasoning off the wire (the model still thinks — only the client-side stream is silenced) |
| `ACP_GLM_SESSION_DIR` | No | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/glm-acp-agent/sessions` | Where session JSON files are persisted |
| `ACP_GLM_DEBUG` | No | — | Set to `true` or `1` to enable verbose debug logging to stderr (shows model selection, API key resolution, tool calls, and usage stats) |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | No | `~/.config` | Where the credentials file is read/written |

### One-time setup

If you'd rather not pass `Z_AI_API_KEY` through your ACP client's environment block, run the interactive setup once and the agent will read the key from disk on subsequent launches:

```bash
glm-acp-agent --setup
```

If you're working from a source clone instead of the published package, use the build output directly:

```bash
node dist/index.js --setup
```

The key is written to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glm-acp-agent/credentials.json` (default: `~/.config/glm-acp-agent/credentials.json`) with `0600` permissions. The `Z_AI_API_KEY` environment variable, when set, always wins over the file.

### Supported models

The agent advertises only the models on the current Z.AI Coding Plan allowlist:

| Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `glm-5.3` | **Default.** Newest 1M-context coding model; thinking mode always on; text-only (images go through Vision MCP) |
| `glm-5.3-flash` | Native-vision 1M-context model; cheaper Coding Plan quota |
| `glm-5-turbo` | Faster Coding Plan reasoning model; 128K context |
| `glm-4.7` | 200K-context reasoning model |

Only models the Coding Plan endpoint serves **under their own name** are advertised. Several ids that used to be listed are now aliases: a request for `glm-5.2` or `glm-5.1` comes back with `"model": "glm-5.3"`, and `glm-4.5-air` comes back as `glm-4.7`. They still work, but advertising them would report a model you are not actually talking to. Z.AI's Coding Plan overview currently also claims `glm-5-turbo` and `glm-4.7` requests are routed to GLM-5.3-Flash; that has not been confirmed by a live probe here, so both ids stay in the picker. `glm-5v-turbo` is no longer on the Coding Plan allowlist — selecting it fails with business code `1311` ("subscription plan does not yet include access").

`ACP_GLM_AVAILABLE_MODELS` lets you advertise any id you like, including the ones above. Custom ids sit outside the supported Coding Plan list — the endpoint rejects any model code Z.AI hasn't whitelisted (business code `1211`). The native-vision path is unchanged, so if your plan does include `glm-5v-turbo`, add it back with `ACP_GLM_AVAILABLE_MODELS` and image blocks still reach it as native `image_url` content parts.

Vision-only chat models (`glm-4v-plus` etc.) are **not** advertised. `glm-5.3-flash` is the built-in native-vision Coding Plan model (`image_url` content parts). Default `glm-5.3`, `glm-5-turbo`, and `glm-4.7` still use the [Vision MCP](#vision-mcp) path. `glm-5v-turbo`, when re-added via the override above, keeps native `image_url` handling as an opt-in exception.

When the model name matches `glm-4.5`, `glm-4.6`, `glm-4.7`, or the `glm-5` family, the agent enables Z.AI's `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` extension and forwards reasoning tokens to the client as `agent_thought_chunk` blocks. This includes `glm-5.3-flash` and `glm-5v-turbo`. `ACP_GLM_THINKING=false` asks for plain completions on models that still accept `thinking.type: "disabled"` (GLM-4.7, GLM-5 Turbo). On GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash the flag is a no-op: those models reject `disabled`, so the agent leaves thinking enabled rather than sending it (see [Thought level](#thought-level-reasoning-effort) below).

#### Thought level (reasoning effort)

The agent advertises a `thought_level` [SessionConfigOption](https://agentclientprotocol.com) so clients that support config options (e.g. a "Thinking" selector) can control reasoning effort per session. The available levels depend on the active model:

| Model | Levels | Mapping to the Z.AI request |
|-------|--------|-----------------------------|
| `glm-5.3` (and `glm-5.2` / `glm-5.1`, which route to 5.3) | `Minimal` / `Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `X-High` / `Max` | `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` + `reasoning_effort` set to the matching value |
| `glm-5.3-flash` | `Low` / `High` / `Max` | Same mapping; Z.AI only documents these three levels for Flash |
| other thinking-capable models | `Off` / `On` | `Off` → `thinking: { type: "disabled" }`; `On` → `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` |

**GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash have no `Off` level, because thinking cannot be turned off on them.** Sending `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` now errors (it is no longer a silent no-op), so `ACP_GLM_THINKING=false` leaves thinking enabled rather than sending `disabled`. Use `glm-4.7` if you need non-reasoning completions — with the caveat that if Coding Plan really routes turbo/4.7 to Flash, a session that picks `glm-4.7` + thought level `Off` may 4xx.

`reasoning_effort` only takes effect on the GLM-5.3 family; `glm-5-turbo` and `glm-4.7` accept the field without validating it and answer identically either way, so the agent omits it for them. New sessions default to `Max`, which is also Z.AI's default when the field is omitted, so out-of-the-box behaviour is unchanged. Switching models re-clamps the level (an effort-ladder selection reverts to `On` when you move to GLM-4.7; an `Off` selection becomes `Max` on GLM-5.3 / Flash; switching from GLM-5.3 onto Flash maps `minimal`→`low`, `medium`→`high`, `xhigh`→`max`) and pushes a `config_option_update`. Clients that don't support config options simply ignore the advertised option and get the default behaviour.

The endpoint validates `reasoning_effort` against `none | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh | max` on GLM-5.3. GLM-5.3-Flash's documented values are only `low | high | max`, so the agent advertises that shorter ladder for Flash. `none` is never offered on either model.

`ACP_GLM_PROMPT_IMAGES=false` still hides the image-attachment capability at session startup. With that flag set, clients should not offer image attachments at all.

Switching to a text-only model is rejected while retained conversation history contains native images. Keep an image-capable model or start a text-only session with a textual description; images are never silently discarded or analyzed as part of a model switch. During an active prompt on a native-image model, wait for the turn to finish before switching to text-only capability. Other compatible selections affect subsequent model calls, while an in-flight call keeps its captured model and reasoning level. Restored histories receive the same compatibility check before a provider request.

### Vision MCP

For `glm-5.3-flash` (built-in) and `glm-5v-turbo` (opt-in via `ACP_GLM_AVAILABLE_MODELS`), pasted ACP image blocks with `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, or `image/png` are sent directly to chat completions as `image_url` content parts. HTTPS image URLs are forwarded as URLs; inline base64 data is sent as a `data:<mime>;base64,...` URI. Unsupported image MIME types are rejected client-side with an inline `<image_unsupported_format>` annotation so the prompt can continue without a provider 4xx.

For non-native models (including default `glm-5.3`), pasted ACP image blocks are not sent to the chat-completions endpoint. Instead, the agent boots `@z_ai/mcp-server` over stdio (via `npx -y @z_ai/mcp-server@latest`) and calls its `image_analysis` tool. The text result is spliced into the user message as `<image_analysis index="N">…</image_analysis>` so the regular Coding Plan model can reason about it.

Prerequisites:

- `npx` on `PATH` (Node 18+ / npm 9+).
- The same `Z_AI_API_KEY` used for chat completions; the agent forwards it to the MCP server as `Z_AI_API_KEY` plus `Z_AI_MODE=ZAI`.

The model can also call `image_analysis` explicitly with `{ image_source: "/path/or/url", prompt?: "…" }`. Vision failures (missing `npx`, MCP startup, quota) are surfaced as actionable errors but never abort the prompt; an inline `<image_analysis_error>` annotation is used so the conversation can continue.

## Running

### Standalone (stdio)

If you installed the published package globally, just run the CLI:

```bash
export Z_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
glm-acp-agent
```

If you built from source, invoke the entry point directly:

```bash
export Z_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
node dist/index.js
```

The agent speaks the ACP newline-delimited JSON protocol over stdin/stdout. You can connect any ACP-compatible client to it.

### Development mode (watch)

When working from a source clone, run `tsc` in watch mode so `dist/` rebuilds on every save:

```bash
export Z_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
npm run dev        # tsc --watch
```

---

## Connecting to an ACP Client

### Zed (recommended for local testing)

[Zed](https://zed.dev) is currently the most polished editor for trying out ACP agents locally — it spawns the agent process over stdio and surfaces it in the agent panel. This is the fastest way to iterate on `glm-acp-agent` before publishing it to the ACP registry or to npm.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- A recent build of [Zed](https://zed.dev/download) that supports the `agent_servers` setting
- Node.js 20.19.0+, 22.13.0+, or 24+ on your `PATH` (`node --version`)
- A Z.AI API key — create one at <https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list>

#### 2. Install the agent

Follow either path from the [Installation](#installation) section above:

- **Quick Start** — `npm install -g glm-acp-agent@latest`. Zed can then spawn the agent with `"command": "glm-acp-agent"`.
- **From source** — clone, `npm install`, `npm run build`. Zed needs the absolute path to the built entry point (no `~`, no `$HOME` shortcuts):

  ```bash
  echo "$(pwd)/dist/index.js"
  ```

#### 3. Wire it into Zed

Open (or create) `~/.config/zed/settings.json` and add an `agent_servers` entry. Pick **one** of the two API-key strategies below.

**Option A — inline `env` block (simplest):**

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "glm": {
      "command": "glm-acp-agent",
      "env": { "Z_AI_API_KEY": "sk-…" }
    }
  }
}
```

If you installed from source instead of the published package, replace `command` / `args` with the absolute path to the build output:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "glm": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/glm-acp-agent/dist/index.js"],
      "env": { "Z_AI_API_KEY": "sk-…" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B — credentials file (no key in your editor settings):**

Run the interactive setup once:

```bash
glm-acp-agent --setup
```

If you're working from a source clone, use the build output directly: `node dist/index.js --setup`.

The key is written to `~/.config/glm-acp-agent/credentials.json` with `0600` permissions. Then drop the `env` block from the Zed entry — the agent will read the file on launch:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "glm": {
      "command": "glm-acp-agent"
    }
  }
}
```

If `Z_AI_API_KEY` is set in the environment **and** a credentials file exists, the environment variable wins.

#### 4. Verify it works

1. Save `settings.json`. Zed reloads settings automatically.
2. Open the **agent panel** (use the command palette: `agent panel: toggle focus`).
3. In the agent picker, select **glm** — Zed labels external agents by their `agent_servers` key.
4. Start a new thread and send a small prompt that exercises a tool, e.g. `Read package.json and tell me the project name.`
5. You should see streaming text, a `read_file` tool call awaiting permission, and (with a thinking-capable model like `glm-5.3`) reasoning surfaced as a separate thought block.

#### 5. Iterating on the agent

After editing the source, rebuild:

```bash
npm run build
```

Zed spawns a fresh agent process per thread, so the easiest way to pick up changes is to **start a new thread** with the glm agent. If you see stale behavior, fully quit and reopen Zed — that guarantees no in-flight process is reused.

For a tighter inner loop, run `npm run dev` in a terminal so `dist/` rebuilds on every save; you only need to start a new Zed thread to test the latest code.

#### 6. Troubleshooting

- **The "glm" agent doesn't appear in the picker.** — `settings.json` likely has a JSON parse error, or your Zed build is older than `agent_servers` support. Open the Zed log via the command palette (`zed: open log`) and look for settings errors.
- **`Error: Cannot find module '/.../dist/index.js'`** — you skipped `npm run build`, or the path in `args` is wrong. It must be absolute and point at a file that exists.
- **`No API key found.`** — neither `Z_AI_API_KEY` nor `~/.config/glm-acp-agent/credentials.json` is set. Use Option A or Option B in step 3.
- **`HTTP 401: Invalid API key`** — your key is wrong, expired, or for the wrong region. Rotate it on <https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list>.
- **A write or command did not run.** — approve the ACP permission prompt for that tool call. Rejected or cancelled prompts are reported back to the model as skipped operations.

### Neovim / VS Code / JetBrains / any ACP client

Any client that supports configuring an ACP agent via a `command` + `args` invocation works the same way:

- If you installed via `npm install -g glm-acp-agent@latest`, set `command` to `glm-acp-agent` (no args required).
- If you built from source, set `command` to `node` and `args` to `["/absolute/path/to/glm-acp-agent/dist/index.js"]`.

Supply `Z_AI_API_KEY` in the environment, or run `glm-acp-agent --setup` once so the agent reads the key from disk on launch.

### Authentication

The agent advertises two authentication methods at `initialize` time:

1. An **`agent`-default** method — the agent will read the API key itself, either from the `Z_AI_API_KEY` environment variable or from the credentials file written by `glm-acp-agent --setup`.
2. An **`env_var`** method (experimental SDK extension) describing the `Z_AI_API_KEY` variable so capable clients can prompt the user and inject it.

ACP clients that support the auth-methods proposal will use whichever method they recognise; clients that don't handle auth methods should set `Z_AI_API_KEY` themselves before launching the agent (or run `glm-acp-agent --setup` once and let the agent read it from disk).

## Building & Testing

```bash
npm run build   # one-shot TypeScript compilation → dist/
npm run dev     # watch mode
npm test        # build + run unit tests with the node:test runner
```

The test suite covers:

- ACP protocol-version negotiation, capability advertising, and auth method shape
- Session lifecycle (`new` / `list` / `close`, filter by `cwd`)
- Prompt loop streaming, tool-call assembly, max-turn cap, cancellation, stop-reason mapping (`stop` → `end_turn`, `length` → `max_tokens`, `content_filter` → `refusal`, `tool_calls` exhausted → `max_turn_requests`)
- Content-block conversion (`text`, `resource_link`, embedded `resource`)
- Token usage reporting on the `PromptResponse`
- Tool call lifecycle (`pending` → `in_progress` → `completed` / `failed`)
- Agent-owned local file and shell tools that work without ACP `fs` / `terminal` client capabilities
- Permission flows for `write_file` and `run_command` (allow / reject / cancel)
- Shell-quoted argument handling for `list_files` and `run_command`
- GLM streaming: text deltas, `reasoning_content` deltas, multi-chunk tool-call assembly, and trailing usage
- Image preprocessing through a mocked Vision MCP client and graceful degradation on Vision MCP failures

## Troubleshooting

- **`No API key found.`** — either set `Z_AI_API_KEY` in the environment, or run `glm-acp-agent --setup` (or `node dist/index.js --setup` from a source clone) once to store the key on disk.
- **`HTTP 401: Invalid API key`** — your key is wrong or expired; rotate it on <https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list>.
- **Writes or commands never get to run.** — make sure your ACP client supports `session/request_permission` and that you approve the prompt for the specific tool call.
